# Portfolio for Philip Kalinowski
Hello, if you are reading this and made it this far -- this is my portfolio GitHub! All the files and information can be found here.

## Ideas and Things to Work On
- Addition of Stock Tracker Application (WIP)
- Change full section of projects to individual sections per project
- possible have two columns; one for school, one for personal
    - upon further personal projects, separate pages
- different theme selections (e.g. light mode and dark mode)
